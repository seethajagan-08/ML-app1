# 🤖 Machine Learning - Marks predicting App

  I completed a Machine Learning project where I built a Simple Linear Regression model to predict student marks based on the number of hours they studied. The goal was to understand how the amount of time spent studying influences performance.

Implemented an End-to-End workflow from preprocessing to deployment 
 👨🏻‍💻 => Data Preprocessing ➡️ Model training ➡️ Evaluation ➡️ Deployment
